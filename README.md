## Description

This application uses REACT to create a portfolio that displays recent projects from my GitHub. Designed in the form of a SPA (Single Page Application), the application uses scroll to unveal new components, like the About, Projects, and Contact. A fixed navbar can be used to jump to specific components on the page. 

<br>

## File Format:

Components within the app.js file are formatted like so:

    function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <Wrapper>
                <Navbar />
                <Main/>
                <About />
                <Projects/>
                <Contact/>
            </Wrapper>
        </div>
    );
    }

However, the Main component acts most like the wrapper. Fixed elements within Main have a z-index of -5 as to act like a background for the rest of the components which all have z-index's of 2 and positions of absolute. This gives the page a simple 'parallax' feel on scroll.
